shaft_encoder2 is a hack of the drum repo to implement just the
motor shaft encoding and odometer functions.

It is based on a DiscoveryF4 board with the encoder wiring identical
to that used in drum/levelwind. This allows the levelwind DiscoveryF4
unit to be used for initial tests without the levelwind stepper and
related hardware connected. Also simplifies later movement of code
to drum/levelwind.
